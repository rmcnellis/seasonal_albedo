Seasonal Albedo data

## general information
This repository houses data from a study in the Texas High Plains examining the response of crop albedo to changes in climate from summer to winter and the leaf traits driving this response. The dataset corresponds to the article *Leaf traits drive seasonal increase in the albedo of Texas High Plains agricultural systems* by McNellis and Smith.

## file descriptions
### /data/seasonal_albedo_leaf.csv
This file contains stomatal conductance, leaf chlorophyll, leaf thickness, leaf area, and leaf mass. The specific column information is:
- *date*: the date of measurement, corresponds to *date* column in all other files
- *ID*: the sample ID indicating site_species_plot, corresponds to *ID* column in all other files
- *rep*: the replicate within the plot
- *conductance*: stomatal conductance measured with a Meter Porometer SC-1 (mmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>)
- *temperature*: leaf temperature measured with a Meter Porometer SC-1 (degrees Celsius)
- *leaf_angle*: the angle of the leaf from 0 - 90 measured with a PhotosynQ MultispeQ v2 (degrees)
- *rel_chlorophyll*: relative chlorophyll content measured with a PhotosynQ MultispeQ v2 using a modified version of the SPAD parameter
- *thickness*: thickness of the leaf measured with a PhotosynQ MultispeQ v2 (Âµm)
- *leaf_area*: area of leaf (mm<sup>2</sup>)
- *leaf_mass*: mass of leaf (mg)
